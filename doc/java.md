what is an java ?

java introduced by james goslin in 1995 through sun-micro systems team.
java is high level programming language.
it is platform independent because java byte code can run any platform such as windows, linux, max operating systems.
in the java, source code converted to the byte code.byte code means machine code, it is not human readable file.

why java is famous ?

platform independent
advaned features
multi-threaded
high performance
oop concepts

what are the oop concepts ?

encapsulation
inheritance
polymorphism
abstraction

what is an encapsulation ?

data wrapup in to a single interface
this process through data get a validational protectional level.
example => car , tv

how to reate fully encapsulated class ?

all properties private
put getters and setters to all methods
optionally override tostring method

what is an inheritance ?

one class depend on anoth class or classes.
this process through parent class features give to child class.
example => include iphone15 version features and add new features for release iphone16 version.

what is an polymorphism ?

single interface, many forms

what is an abstraction ?

hide the process and show only output.
example => AC machine process don't show us but we get output as get AC

what are the two types of polymorphism ?

compile-time polymorphism
run-time polymorphism

what is an method overloading ?

same name, different parameters count, type

how to overload methods ?

change parameters count
change parameters type
change parameters order

what is an object ?

object is a blueprint of a class
car = new car();

what is an interface ?

use point as interaction between software and hardware components.
interface methods are always public and abstract.
interface cannot contain constructor.
interface cannot be create objects.
interface methods do not have a body

what are the three interface types ?

marker interface - methods 0 (serializable)
functional interface

what is an constructor ?

constructor refers to block of code used to initialize an object.
constructors have not return type
creating an object will call a constructor automatically.
constructor can overloading.
(default constructor , parameterized constructor)

what is the main purpose of the default constructor ?

commonly used to initialize instance variables with default values.
widely used for object creation.

what is the all-args constructor do ?

initializing the instance variables with provided values
these constructors takes the arguments.

what is jdk, jvm, JRE ?
